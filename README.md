# **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) Portfolio**

## **Overview**

Welcome to my academic portfolio for **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**.
This repository showcases my coursework, projects, and applied learning experiences completed as part of my **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** with a **concentration in Software Engineering**.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my growth as a software developer, my ability to apply programming principles to solve real-world problems, and my commitment to writing maintainable, efficient, and professional-quality code.

Each course folder contains source code, project documentation, and reflective insights designed to highlight key concepts and learning outcomes.

## **Program Goals**

As part of the **Software Engineering concentration**, my studies emphasize the following areas:

* **Software Design and Development:** Applying design patterns, modular programming, and version control to create scalable and efficient solutions.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Leveraging algorithmic thinking to improve program performance and solve computational problems effectively.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Building robust, reusable, and maintainable systems using classes and encapsulation.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Ensuring code reliability through unit testing, validation, and debugging practices.
* **Collaboration and Agile Methodologies:** Using tools like Git, GitHub, and SCRUM principles to manage development projects collaboratively.
* **Ethics and Professionalism:** Following industry standards and ethical practices in software design and implementation.
