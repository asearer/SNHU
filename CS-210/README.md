# **CS-210: Programming Languages**

## **Overview**

This repository contains projects completed for **CS-210: Programming Languages** at **Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)**. The course emphasizes the fundamentals of software development, problem-solving, and structured programming using the C++ language. Each project demonstrates professional programming practices, including modular design, debugging, documentation, and reflection on the learning process.

## **Key Learning Objectives**

* Apply **object-oriented programming** (OOP) principles to real-world problems.
* Write **modular, maintainable C++ code** using classes and functions.
* Implement **file input and output** to process and store data.
* Use **control structures, loops, and conditional logic** effectively.
* Utilize **C++ Standard Library containers** such as maps and vectors for efficiency.
* Follow **industry-standard coding and documentation practices**.

## **Highlight: Corner Grocer Project**

The **Corner Grocer Item Tracker** is a C++ console application that reads daily grocery purchase records from a file, calculates the frequency of each item, and outputs this information in both numeric and visual (histogram) formats. It also generates a backup file, `frequency.dat`, for long-term data storage.

The project demonstrates:

* File handling and persistence using C++ streams.
* Class-based program design using encapsulation and abstraction.
* Menu-driven interaction for usability and control.
* Data organization and counting with `map<string, int>`.
* Code readability, maintainability, and user input validation.

## **Tools and Environment**

* **Programming Language:** C++
* **Operating System:** macOS
* **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
