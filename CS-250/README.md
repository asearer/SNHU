# Computer Science Program – Essential Questions

## Reflection on Core Concepts

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with listening carefully, asking clarifying questions, and understanding the problem from the user’s perspective instead of assuming solutions. Requirements are often vague at first, so translating them into clear specifications is essential before writing code.

Creating **user stories** helps bridge the gap between user needs and technical implementation. User stories break requirements into small, clear descriptions of functionality from the user’s point of view (e.g., *“As a user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.”*). They improve communication, prioritize features, and ensure development stays focused on delivering value.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development by breaking large problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Planning, designing data structures, implementing features incrementally, and testing continuously are key steps in building reliable software.

I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as:

* Iterative development with short development cycles (sprints)
* Continuous feedback and regular code reviews
* Frequent testing and integration
* Adapting to changing requirements

Agile methodologies encourage flexibility and collaboration, which lead to better quality software and stronger alignment with user needs.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, respecting others’ ideas, and contributing consistently to shared goals. Collaboration is essential in software development because projects often require multiple perspectives and skill sets.

Good team members:

* Write clean, maintainable code
* Document their work clearly
* Participate actively in discussions and code reviews
* Accept feedback and improve based on it
* Support teammates and share knowledge

Strong teamwork improves productivity, reduces errors, and creates a positive development environment.
