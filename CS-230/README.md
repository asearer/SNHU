## Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Requirements

The Gaming Room was the client requesting the development of a web-based gaming application. Their goal was to expand their existing game into a multi-platform environment that allows multiple users and teams to play simultaneously. The software needed to support scalable user management, team management, unique game instance handling, and cross-platform accessibility. The primary focus was designing an application architecture that supports reliability, efficiency, and maintainability while meeting the client’s functional requirements.

## What I Did Well in Developing This Documentation

I believe I did particularly well in clearly defining system requirements, identifying constraints, and outlining appropriate architectural design decisions. Breaking down the system into components such as memory management, platform considerations, and object design helped ensure clarity and organization. I also made sure the documentation aligned directly with the client’s goals and technical needs.

## How the Design Document Helped During Development

Working through a detailed design document before coding made development much more structured and efficient. It provided a clear blueprint to follow, reducing uncertainty during implementation. By planning the system architecture, classes, and interactions ahead of time, I was able to focus more on implementation rather than redesigning components mid-development. It also helped identify potential issues early in the planning stage.

## If I Could Revise One Part

If I could revise one part of my documentation, I would improve the level of detail in my diagrams and technical explanations. Adding more visual representations and deeper justification for certain design choices would strengthen the document. Improving clarity around scalability and performance considerations would also enhance its quality.

## Interpreting User Needs and Importance

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the core functionality they required and ensuring the software design supported those goals. I translated business requirements into technical specifications and design decisions. Understanding user needs is critical because software must solve real problems effectively. If the system does not align with the user’s expectations or requirements, it will not provide value.

## Approach to Software Design

I approached software design by analyzing requirements first, identifying key system components, and then designing an architecture that supports flexibility and scalability. In the future, I would continue using strategies such as requirement analysis, UML diagrams, iterative design, prototyping, and stakeholder feedback to improve accuracy and efficiency. These techniques ensure that the software aligns with client expectations while remaining maintainable and scalable.
